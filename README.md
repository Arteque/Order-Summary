# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

Hi, my name is Ahmed Lemssiah, and this is my solution for the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

The project was made years ago but was never uploaded to GitHub. 
**Why?** 
Because I had no clue how to use GitHub ðŸ™ˆ. This is a good way to see how far I've come, and I am proud of every second of my journey as a web designer / frontend developer.
